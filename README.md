# Network-Cable-Management-Project

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to reorganize all network cables in each closet within the building and create a user-friendly Network Booklet and Spreadsheet. These resources will help technicians efficiently navigate and locate patch panels, along with identifying the corresponding ports they are connected to.

### Skills Learned


-Proper use of cable management tools such as cable combs, Velcro straps, and zip ties.

-Ability to locate and document patch panel connections for better troubleshooting.

-Enhanced knowledge of network infrastructure layout and organization.

-Improved documentation and record-keeping skills for IT environments.

-Hands-on experience with network closet organization best practices.

### Tools Used

Cable management tools (Velcro, zip ties, cable labels).

Network mapping software (e.g., NetBox, SolarWinds, or a simple spreadsheet).

Patch panel documentation using spreadsheets or a database.

Labeling tools (Label printer, color-coded labels).

## Steps
Assessment & Planning

Inspect the current state of network closets.

Identify tangled or mismanaged cables.

Develop a labeling and documentation plan.

Reorganization & Labeling

Unplug and neatly reroute cables where necessary.

Use Velcro straps to bundle cables and maintain airflow.

Label each cable with a unique identifier for easy tracking.

Documentation

Create a Network Booklet with closet layouts, patch panel mappings, and key port details.

Develop a Spreadsheet that lists each port, its corresponding device, and location.

Final Review & Testing

Ensure all cables are properly connected.

Verify network connectivity and troubleshoot any connection issues.

Share the documentation with the IT team for future reference.
