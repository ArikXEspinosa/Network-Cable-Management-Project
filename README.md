# Network-Cable-Management-Project

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to reorganize all network cables in each closet within the building and create a user-friendly Network Booklet and Spreadsheet. These resources will help technicians efficiently navigate and locate patch panels, along with identifying the corresponding ports they are connected to.

### Skills Learned


-Proper use of cable management tools such as cable combs, Velcro straps, and zip ties.

-Ability to locate and document patch panel connections for better troubleshooting.

-Enhanced knowledge of network infrastructure layout and organization.

-Improved documentation and record-keeping skills for IT environments.

-Hands-on experience with network closet organization best practices.

### Tools Used

Cable management tools (Velcro, zip ties, cable labels).

Network mapping software (ExtremeNetwork).

Patch panel documentation using spreadsheets and Packet Template
### üìÅ Network Directory Example
**[Trailblazer Master Network Directory (.xlsx)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19556284/Trailblazer.Master.Network.Directory.xlsx)**  
A comprehensive spreadsheet for documenting switch ports, patch panel connections, closet locations, and device mappings.

### üìÑ Network Packet Template
**üëâ [Network Documentation Packet (View on Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7dvufmXRGma9Mzcw8oTcML5iSQTgUaM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112130089608892881782&rtpof=true&sd=true)**  
A formalized Word document used for physical network packet documentation. This includes labeled closet layouts, port usage, and infrastructure notes to support cable management and upgrades.


## Steps
Assessment & Planning

Inspect the current state of network closets.

Identify tangled or mismanaged cables.

Develop a labeling and documentation plan.

Reorganization & Labeling

Unplug and neatly reroute cables where necessary.

Use Velcro straps to bundle cables and maintain airflow.

Label each cable with a unique identifier for easy tracking.

Documentation

Create a Network Booklet with closet layouts, patch panel mappings, and key port details.

Develop a Spreadsheet that lists each port, its corresponding device, and location.

Final Review & Testing

Ensure all cables are properly connected.

Verify network connectivity and troubleshoot any connection issues.

Share the documentation with the IT team for future reference.
